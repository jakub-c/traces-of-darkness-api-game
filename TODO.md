# Todo list

I work on this project in short focused sessions, this list's supposed to keep me on track when I revisit the codebase

- [x] turn slug into an array
- ~~[ ] test `findParentLocationEndpoint`~~
- [x] ~~create nested URL structure for the API like: `old-house/hallway`~~
- [x] ~~add "image/*" response to the endpoints if an image illustrating the endpoint (that is the location on the map) exists~~
- [x]  ~~refactor buildApi and subsequent functions~~
